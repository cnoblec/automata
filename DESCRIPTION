Title: Cellular Automata
Description: Implements a cellular automata class, featuring a discrete
    lattice (in this case, a pixel-based lattice) where pixels' behaviour
    depends on their neighbours and some deterministic rules. Run simulations
    with an initial lattice that evolves over time and exhibits this
    deterministic behaviour.
